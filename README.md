General Information
-----------
This was made as a final project for a TCSS 445 (Database Systems Design) class. Development stopped in late March 2014, so most NPM modules are out of date when compared to their current versions. It's not guarenteed that this project will still function on newer versions of the NPM modules than the ones specified in the package.json file.

Working Demo
------------
A mostly working demo version is still active on: http://senjuflix.herokuapp.com
